Thanks for viewing my portfolio. This directory contains projects and anlysis that I performe myself on freely available data. The technology used (R, Python. HTML/css/js) varies from project to project, as I continue to build the contents of this folder.

The contents are the following:

* wine.quality: In this project, I used freely available wine quality data to predict quality rating. Model build is random forest with 11 predictors and a 6 value categorical predictor - quality rating.
